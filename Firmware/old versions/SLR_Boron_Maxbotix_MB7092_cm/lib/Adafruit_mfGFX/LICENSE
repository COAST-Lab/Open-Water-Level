/*
Multifont GFX library is adapted from Adafruit_GFX library by Paul Kourany
v1.0.0, May 2014 Initial Release
v1.0.1, June 2014 Font Compilation update

Please read README.pdf for details

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common
set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).  It needs to be
paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry
(to handle the lower-level functions).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source code, please
support Adafruit & open-source hardware by purchasing products from Adafruit!
