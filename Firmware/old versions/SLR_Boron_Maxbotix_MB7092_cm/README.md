# SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_MB7092_cm

Script intended to operate a 1 cm resolution, waterproof ultrasonic sensor (MB7092 from Maxbotix) with a Particle Boron. Uses SLR_Boron_Maxbotix_Analog firmware and modifies that script (which was designed for a different sensor with 1 in resolution). Modified by L. Edwards in Spring 2023 and pushed to GitHub initially on 17-May-2023 by P. Bresnahan.
